To create the database used in this work, we used the image
bank of the German satellite RapidEye [12]

This satellite was selected because it has a spatial
resolution of 5 meters per pixel, providing a greater wealth of
details when considering lower resolution satellites.

 essas imagens datam de 2014, pois o governo brasileiro adquiriu apenas imagens entre 2011 e 2014.
 
 The region chosen comprises the Tapaj√≥s Environmental
Protection Area [13] and part of the Crepori National Forest
[14]

This region was selected due
to the abundance of gold exploration areas and the fact that it
has large areas of national forest and indigenous reserves in its
adjacencies.


To the development of this work, it was necessary to annotate
the images of the gold exploration locations. Until the writing
of this work, there were no databases with publicly accessible
annotations

QGIS. It
was possible to load the images acquired from RapidEye and
perform the annotation of such areas.


However, this information does not indicate
the exact boundaries of the areas but only provides the region
where a gold exploration operation is located.

In addition, visual validation of the annotated areas was
performed using the aerial view provided by Bing Maps (Aerial
View - Bing Maps) [17].

inally, binary masks were generated,



The proposed method diagram for the segmentation of gold
exploration areas in Amazon forest regions is summarized in
Figure 4. The first step is the resizing of the created database.
Then we have the database augmentation, followed by the
definition of the architecture and the optimization of the loss
and optimization functions used during the model learning
process. Finally, we evaluated the obtained results.
